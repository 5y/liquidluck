Installation
=============

If you are familiar with Python, it is strongly suggested that you install
everything in virtualenv.

If you are a pythoner, and you have no idea about virtualenv, please do search
the internet.

Distribute and Pip
------------------

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X, you are the lucky one::

    $ sudo pip install liquidluck

If no pip available, try easy_install::

    $ sudo easy_install liquidluck


Sorry, I have no knowledge about Windows, but it really works on Windows.
Cygwin and MinGW would make a better life with UNIX software.


Install with GIT
-----------------

If you prefer git, that is great. You can get the very latest code at GitHub::

    $ git clone http://github.com/lepture/liquidluck.git
